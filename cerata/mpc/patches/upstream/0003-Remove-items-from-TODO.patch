-Add support for rounding mode MPFR_RNDA.

 Improve speed of Im (atan) for x+i*y with small y, for instance by using
 the Taylor series directly. See also the discussion

-- from Andreas Enge 25 June 2009:
-  correctly rounded roots of unity zeta_n^i
 - implement a root-finding algorithm using the Durand-Kerner method
   (cf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand%E2%80%93Kerner_method).
